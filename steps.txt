first create folder in the local repo with the same name that you wish to have in git hub repo.

open git bash
if you have already created folder then dont do this or you the properfile type as below:

>>>

cd file_name     --> git git-explain (name same as in github)

--check : ls -a  or ls ----

git init

git add file name   --> git add git-explain 

git commit -m "(any valid message)"     --> git commit -m "Initial push to github from local repo"

git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"  --> git config --global user.email "mohammadrafai.1d@gamil.com"

git config --global user.name "your_name"   -->     git config --global user.name "Mohammad-Rafi" 

---- check status :  git status -----

repeat --->  git add file_name
             git commit -m "(any valid message)"

git branch -M main      -->     git branch -M main

--- exit the current file :  cd  ---

--- check for ls -a  : we are out of folder and searching for .ssh ---

--- now get into folder after checking .ssh if not found enter as below --> to enter into folder again type cd file_name ---

cd file_name

ssh-keygen -o   --->  if already found before not required to do agian this step.(only this)

    cd  (by this input we are out of folder repo)

    ls -a (in this case we are trying to open .ssh folder to get ssh key)

    --- enter into .ssh folder ---

    cd .ssh  (we enter the ssh file by giving this input)

    ls -a    (we did this to know the exact ssh key id with pub extention i.e .pub)

    cat (somecode-id).pu    ---> copy the code that given by the bash and paste it in the ssh keys in settings og github.

    cd

    cd folder_name   --> we agian enter into the git hub local repo

    ls -a (to check the inside main content to ensue just incase)  

    git remote add origin (copy ssh link from code site of the named repo)

    git push -u origin main
