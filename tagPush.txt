actually we have another here to cover that is : 

when a developer is creating some software definitely there will be some versioin changes in the software regulary .

fo that to create such version updates , in gereal it is tags : 
    so lets create v1.0 and push this the git hub repository
    for that we have a seperate commad ----> 

        git tag -a (any_veraion name) -m "(a vaild message)
        git status 
        git add file_name
        git commit -m "(any vaild message)"
        git push origin main
        git push origin (version name given)

        with thid its like given a type of 1st version .
