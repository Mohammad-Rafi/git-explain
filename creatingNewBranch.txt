the abovea re to switch from one branch to another;

the below is how to create brach :

    git checkout -b (branch-name) 
    git switch   -c  (brach-name)   --create (branch)


this branching helps when there is alot bug issue or any faiure of work orelse the code you just wrote became a unexpected outtput so dont want to pulish to people so you think to exteriment that such cases or in any other ways a great way to use.


to switch between be=ranches use command :
    git switch (branch_name) 
    git checkout (branch_name)


to how many branches we have created use command :
    git branch          ----> local branches shows
    git branch --all   -----> local and  remote branches shows
